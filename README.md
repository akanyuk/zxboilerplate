ZX Spectrum sjasmplus+vscode boilerplate

## How to use
1. Download and install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
2. Install Z80 Macro-Assembler extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mborik.z80-macroasm
3. (optional) If you want to use your local sjasmplus build, open `.vscode/tasks.json` and white down your correct path to `sjasmplus` in `"command": "./_sjasmplus/sjasmplus",` line.

That's all! Now you can use `Run build task` (Ctrl+B on Windows or âŒ˜+B on macOS by default) to compile your `main.asm` file.

## Further steps

Snapshot will be saved in your project folder by default, as well as labelslist. 

Probably, you want to configure `savesna` and `labelslist` paths to your Unreal folder in order to use a snapshot Quickload and Labels supports. Just write down the paths to these files at the very end of the `main.asm` file. I.e.:


```
		savesna "/path/to/unreal/qsave1.sna",start
		labelslist "/path/to/unreal/user.l"
```


If you need to make your custom bat/shell scripts or build tasks, you should feel free to make everything you want.

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks manual for details.
